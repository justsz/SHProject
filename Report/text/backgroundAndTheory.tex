\section{Background or Theory}

This section should cover the theory of the material in the project
in sufficient detail to make the following work understandable to the
average physicist. It should not contain large sections of standard
bookwork, but should contain references to this material. The exact
contents of this section will depend on the project being undertaken.

This section should contain only the
relevant theory. In particular a life history of the inventor of the
technique to be used is
totally irrelevant\footnote{I have seen a report that contained three pages
on the life of Gabor, and it was not very interesting.}. Here use common sense
and the general rule, ``If in doubt: leave it out'', however
include information that you judge would be useful to one of your
peers if they wehe to repeat the project. If you are
undertaking a 12 week project and it includes a literature search, put the
result of the search here. As a rough guide this section should be
about 3-4 pages for a 6 week project, longer for longer projects.

Note that if the project consists of a series of short experiments
each of which requires a different theory and method, it may be appropriate
to have one {\bf Theory, Method, Results} section for each
experiment.
