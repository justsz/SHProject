\section{Conclusion}
This section should summarise the results obtained, detail
conclusions reached, suggest future work, and changes that you would make if you repeated the
experiment. This section should in general be short, 100 to 150 words
being typical for most projects.
\par\noindent
If you have opted to have multiple {\bf Theory, Method, Results}
sections, draw all the results together in a {\bf single} conclusion.
