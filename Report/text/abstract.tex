Simulations and data analysis were used to examine and evaluate the ranking system of British Orienteering. Generated and real data produced plausible rankings giving confidence to believe that the system is generally accurate and independent of initial setup. An issue of the rank distribution shrinking during repeated run-throughs of race data remains unresolved and impedes understanding of the system's convergence.
