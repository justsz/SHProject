\section{Introduction}

The introduction section of the report should introduce the project in
more detail than in the abstract. In particular it should present the
motivation, the aims, outline of techniques used, and the scope of the project. 
It should also contain references to similar work in the
same field to put your work in the correct context.

As a general rule, people reading the abstract and introduction alone
should have a good idea of the material in the project, the techniques
employed and the results obtained. A typical introduction should be
about 1 page, (300-450 words).
