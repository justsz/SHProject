\section{Appendices}

Material that is useful background to the report, but is not essential,
or whose inclusion within the report  would detract from its
structure and readablity, should be included in appendices. Typical
material could be diagrams of electronic circuits built, specialist
data tables used to analyse results, details of computer programs
written for analysis and display of results, photographic plates,
and, for computational projects, a copy of all written code.

Again be selective. The appendix is {\bf not} an excuse for you to add every
last detail and piece of data, but should be used to assist the reader
of the report by supplying additional material. Not all reports require
appendices and if the report is complete without this additional
material leave it out.
