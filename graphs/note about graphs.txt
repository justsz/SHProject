The plotting package (pyplot) will often plot the graph with a large whitespace after data ends. 
It looks like it sets up delimiters on the axis and plots until the last delimiter beyond which there are no data.
For example, if the delimiters are 5000 apart and data ends at 10001, the plot will draw up to 15000 leaving 4999 worth of blank space.
